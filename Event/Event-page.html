                  <p class="event-body">
                    The world today is changing at an unprecedented pace, and
                    experiencing a paradigm shift worldwide with the digital
                    transformation of higher education. It would perhaps be
                    unwise to assume that COVID-19 will be the last global
                    emergency of its kind and that there will be no need for
                    future generations to learn the lessons of the pandemic. A
                    paradigm shift must take place in the global education
                    system worldwide by narrowing the education-industry
                    knowledge and skill gap. The focus has shifted from
                    employment to employability; that is, educating students so
                    they are capable of evolving and adapting to any changes
                    that may arise. This is no small task but one that higher
                    education is well-suited for. Higher education today is
                    viewed as the prime educational mechanism for creating
                    work-ready graduates for a knowledge-based society (Nerland
                    et al., 2018). The success of a higher education institution
                    and its teaching is being assessed by observers in terms of
                    graduates’ employability in society (Osborne and
                    Grant-Smith, 2017). Despite the many potential benefits
                    associated with completing a higher education degree, for
                    most students their motivation to complete a higher
                    education degree is based on the belief of greater
                    employment opportunities (Norton et al., 2019). The
                    institutions are being transformed to focus on satisfying
                    student and employer needs, and many programmes are becoming
                    more skill-based in orientation to provide appropriate
                    competencies for future professions (Fuchs and Henning,
                    2017; Milburn-Shaw and Walker, 2017). The use of digital
                    technologies is being mandated by higher education
                    institutions to allow teachers to enhance their teaching
                    practices and to ensure students are equipped with
                    knowledge, skills, and dispositions for working in the 21st
                    century (Nykvist and Mukherjee, 2016). 
                  </p>
                  <p class="event-body">Digital technologies
                    have brought change to the higher education learning
                    experience. Higher education institutions are leveraging
                    digital technologies to respond to the economic pressures
                    confronting them and to justify their role and purpose in
                    society. Universities are increasingly expected to operate
                    as if they were in a market and less as a form of public
                    good (Gourlay and Oliver, 2018). The marketization of higher
                    education has led to pressure on institutions to deliver
                    fit-for-purpose programs using current digital technologies
                    to satisfy students’ needs and expectations and to be
                    commercially viable. The needs and expectations of students
                    are changing in response to the ready availability of
                    digitally-based information. Students are moving from being
                    passive learners of content to active consumers and
                    participants. Higher education institutions are attempting
                    to satisfy the needs and expectations of students by
                    integrating digital technologies into curricula. This
                    integration of digital technologies is viewed as a means for
                    higher education institutions to remain competitive in
                    pursuing their strategic goals (Pucciarelli and Kaplan,
                    2016) and in producing work-ready graduates. The trend of
                    increasing reliance on digital technologies in higher
                    education has not proceeded without criticism. For example,
                    Tettegah and McCreery (2015) pointed out that academics are
                    concerned with the increased use of technologies by students
                    in learning environments because they no longer have the
                    opportunity for sufficient face-to-face interactions with
                    students; and they are unable to ascertain the emotional
                    state of students and offer the necessary support. The
                    future of nations depends on the effective utilization of
                    science, technology, and innovation as tools for economic
                    development (OECD, 2016b).</p>
                   
                      <h4 class="green-head"> 2.0 APPLICATION OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY IN AGRICULTURE, SCIENCE, 			HEALTHCARE, AND 	ENVIRONMENT</h4>
                      <p class="event-body">Modern technology has had a significant impact on many industries, including agriculture, science, healthcare, and the environment. Here are some examples of how modern technology is being applied in these fields:</p>
                    
                    <p class="event-body">
                       <b>A. Agriculture: </b>The most essential issue in the world today is food supply. The demand for food has increased by more than twice the population growth rate over the past 40 years. According to United Nation's report by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), global hunger numbers rose to as many as 828 million in 2021; about 11.7% of the global population, or nearly 924 million people faced food insecurity at severe levels, and do not have enough food for their active and healthy lives (FAO et al., 2022). Modern technology is transforming agriculture through the use of precision agriculture techniques, which involves the use of sensors, GPS technology, Drones, Automation, IoT Sensors, Soil sensors, Weather monitoring and Agricultural robots other tools to collect data on crops and soil conditions and other activities. These data is then used to optimize planting, irrigation, fertilization, and other farming practices. The use of precision agriculture can increase crop yields, reduce waste, and improve sustainability (AEO Logic, 2022a).
                    </p>
                    <p class="event-body">
                      <b>B. Science: </b>Modern technology is revolutionizing scientific research by enabling researchers to collect and analyze data more efficiently and effectively (Girasa et al., 2022). For example, high-performance computing systems are being used to process large amounts of data in fields such as genomics, climate science, and astronomy. In addition, advances in imaging technology are allowing scientists to visualize and study complex biological processes at the cellular level. Latest technological developments that are available and will affect profoundly virtually the entire landscape of human activity. Rarely has any scientific- or technology-driven innovation encompass almost all facets of endeavors, whether examined from scientific, sociological, political, philosophical, or legal viewpoints. The two current major technologies, namely blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI), and the more futuristic quantum computing (QC).
                    </p>
                    <p class="event-body">
                   <b>C. Healthcare:  </b>Modern technology is transforming healthcare through the use of telemedicine, electronic health records, and artificial intelligence (Healthcaredive, 2023). Telemedicine allows patients to receive medical care remotely, reducing the need for in-person visits and improving access to care. Electronic health records enable healthcare providers to securely share patient information and coordinate care more effectively. Artificial intelligence is being used to analyze medical data and identify patterns and insights that can inform treatment decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="event-body">
                      <b>D. Environment:   </b>Modern technology is being applied in numerous ways to address environmental challenges (UNCTAD, 2023). For example, sensors and remote monitoring systems are being used to track air and water quality, detect pollution, and monitor wildlife populations. In addition, renewable energy technologies such as solar and wind power are becoming increasingly affordable and accessible, helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.
